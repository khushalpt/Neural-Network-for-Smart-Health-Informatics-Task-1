# Neural-Network-for-Smart-Health-Informatics-Task-1
Utilizing deep learning (DL) techniques. The time required (in minutes) is provided for doctors to attend patients at the ER at the hospital. Each doctor's expected time to attend each patient and the overall optimized value is provided in the dataset. The dataset (folder name: DS) contains 1000 .csv files, each illustrating the time required for 50 doctors and 50 patients. By extending the task 1, you have to apply deep learning techniques to train your models using the training data and then, in the test phase, predict the optimized time required using the trained model.
